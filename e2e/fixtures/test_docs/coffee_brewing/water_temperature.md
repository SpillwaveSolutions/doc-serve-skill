# Water Temperature for Coffee

## The Ideal Range

Water temperature significantly affects coffee extraction and is one of the most important variables in brewing. The ideal range is:

- **Minimum**: 195 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius)
- **Maximum**: 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 degrees Celsius)
- **Optimal**: 200-202 degrees Fahrenheit (93-94 degrees Celsius)

This temperature range, established by the Specialty Coffee Association, provides the best balance between extracting desirable flavor compounds while leaving behind bitter elements.

## Why Temperature Matters

Coffee extraction is a chemical process where hot water dissolves soluble compounds from the ground coffee. Temperature controls the rate and extent of this extraction.

### The Science
- Higher temperatures increase the kinetic energy of water molecules
- This accelerates the dissolution of flavor compounds
- Different compounds extract at different rates and temperatures
- Acids extract first, followed by sugars, then bitter compounds

## Temperature Effects

### Too Hot (Above 205°F / 96°C)

When water is too hot, it over-extracts the coffee grounds:
- **Taste**: Bitter, harsh, burnt flavors
- **Body**: Thin and astringent
- **Cause**: Excessive extraction of bitter compounds and tannins

Using boiling water (212°F / 100°C) is a common mistake that ruins otherwise good coffee.

### Too Cold (Below 195°F / 90°C)

When water is too cold, it under-extracts the coffee:
- **Taste**: Sour, acidic, weak, underdeveloped
- **Body**: Thin and watery
- **Cause**: Insufficient extraction of sugars and flavor compounds

### Just Right (195-205°F / 90-96°C)

Proper temperature produces balanced extraction:
- **Taste**: Sweet, complex, balanced acidity
- **Body**: Full and satisfying
- **Result**: Clear expression of coffee's origin characteristics

## Method-Specific Temperatures

### Espresso
- **Range**: 200-202 degrees Fahrenheit (93-94°C)
- **Notes**: Precision is critical; most machines maintain exact temperature
- **Why**: Short extraction time requires optimal temperature for complete extraction

### Pour Over
- **Range**: 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit (90-96°C)
- **Notes**: Start at 205°F; temperature drops during brewing
- **Why**: Longer brew time allows some flexibility in starting temperature

### French Press
- **Range**: 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit (90-96°C)
- **Notes**: Let boiling water rest 30-60 seconds before pouring
- **Why**: Immersion method is forgiving but benefits from consistent temperature

### Cold Brew
- **Range**: Room temperature or refrigerator (35-70°F / 2-21°C)
- **Notes**: Extended steep time (12-24 hours) compensates for low temperature
- **Why**: Cold water extracts slowly, producing smooth, low-acid coffee

## Maintaining Temperature

### Pre-heating
Always pre-heat your brewing equipment (carafe, cup, French press) with hot water before brewing. Cold equipment rapidly drops water temperature.

### Kettle Selection
An electric gooseneck kettle with temperature control is ideal. It maintains precise temperature and provides controlled pouring.

### Altitude Considerations
Water boils at lower temperatures at high altitude. At 5,000 feet, water boils at 202°F. Adjust expectations accordingly.

## Quick Temperature Tips

1. If you don't have a thermometer, let boiling water rest 30-45 seconds
2. Pre-heat all equipment before brewing
3. Darker roasts often benefit from slightly lower temperatures
4. Lighter roasts can handle the higher end of the range
