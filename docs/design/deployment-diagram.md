### Deployment Overview Description

The Agent Brain system is deployed primarily as a local development tool with the following key components:

1. **Developer Workstation**: The primary deployment target where all components run
2. **Python Virtual Environment**: Isolates dependencies for agent-brain-cli and agent-brain-server
3. **Claude Code**: The IDE integration point via the agent-brain-plugin
4. **State Directory**: Project-specific state stored in `.claude/agent-brain/`
5. **External Services**: Cloud APIs for embeddings (OpenAI) and summarization (Anthropic)

    ' CLI
    component [agent-brain CLI] as cli

    cli --> server_b : "agent-brain --project /project-b"
    cli --> server_c : "agent-brain --project /project-c"

    note bottom of cli
        CLI auto-discovers active instances
        via runtime.json files in each project
    end note
}

' Instance Discovery Flow
note right of proj_a
    **Instance Isolation**
    - Each project has dedicated state
    - Ports auto-assigned (0 = find free)
    - Lock files prevent conflicts
    - Data never shared between projects
end note

@enduml
```

### Multi-Instance Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Project Isolation** | Each project gets its own state directory, database, and server instance |
| **Auto Port Assignment** | Use `--port 0` to auto-assign an available port |
| **Lock Files** | Prevent multiple servers from running for the same project |
| **Instance Discovery** | CLI can list and manage all running instances via `agent-brain list` |

## Deployment Benefits

### Local Development Mode
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with minimal setup
- **Project Isolation**: Each project has independent state and data
- **Fast Iteration**: Hot reload in debug mode for rapid development

### Docker Mode
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent environment across machines
- **Persistence**: Volume mounts preserve data across container restarts
- **Portability**: Easy deployment to any Docker-capable host

### Multi-Instance Mode
- **Parallel Projects**: Work on multiple projects simultaneously
- **Resource Isolation**: Each instance has dedicated resources
- **Auto-Discovery**: CLI automatically finds and manages instances
