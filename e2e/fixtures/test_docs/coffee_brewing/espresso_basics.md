# Espresso Fundamentals

## What is Espresso?

Espresso is a concentrated coffee brewing method that forces hot water through finely ground coffee under high pressure. Originating in Italy, espresso forms the foundation for many popular coffee drinks and is prized for its rich, intense flavor and characteristic crema layer on top.

The word "espresso" means "pressed out" in Italian, referring to the extraction process where water is forced through the compacted coffee grounds at approximately 9 bars of pressure.

## Key Parameters for Perfect Espresso

### Pressure
The ideal brewing pressure is 9 bars (approximately 130 PSI). This high pressure is what distinguishes espresso from other brewing methods and creates the characteristic crema - the golden-brown foam layer that sits atop a well-pulled shot.

### Temperature
Water temperature should be maintained between 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit (90-96 degrees Celsius). The optimal sweet spot is around 200-202 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperature stability is crucial for consistent extraction.

### Extraction Time
A standard espresso shot should extract in 25-30 seconds. Shorter extraction times result in under-extracted, sour shots, while longer times lead to over-extracted, bitter espresso.

### Dose and Yield
- **Dose**: 18-20 grams of finely ground coffee
- **Yield**: 36-40 grams of liquid espresso (approximately 1:2 ratio)
- **Single shot**: 7-9 grams dose, 14-18 grams yield

## Common Espresso-Based Drinks

### Americano
An Americano is espresso diluted with hot water, typically in a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio. This produces a coffee similar in strength to drip coffee but with espresso's distinct flavor profile.

### Cappuccino
A traditional cappuccino consists of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. The typical ratio is one-third espresso, one-third steamed milk, and one-third foam, served in a 5-6 ounce cup.

### Latte
A latte (caffè latte) contains espresso with more steamed milk and a light layer of foam. The ratio is typically 1 part espresso to 3-4 parts steamed milk, making it milder than a cappuccino.

### Macchiato
An espresso macchiato is a shot of espresso "marked" or "stained" with a small amount of milk foam. This preserves the intensity of the espresso while adding a touch of sweetness.

## Troubleshooting Espresso

If your espresso tastes sour, the shot may be under-extracted. Try a finer grind or longer extraction time. If it tastes bitter, it may be over-extracted - use a coarser grind or shorter extraction time.
