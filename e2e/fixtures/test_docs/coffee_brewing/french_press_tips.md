# French Press Brewing

## Method Overview

French press (also called press pot or plunger pot) is an immersion brewing method where coffee grounds steep directly in hot water before being separated by a metal mesh plunger. This full-immersion technique produces a rich, full-bodied cup with more oils and sediment than filtered methods.

The French press was patented in 1929 by Italian designer Attilio Calimani, though similar devices existed earlier. It remains one of the most accessible brewing methods, requiring no electricity and minimal equipment.

## Equipment

### The Press
A standard French press consists of:
- A cylindrical glass or stainless steel carafe
- A plunger with a fine metal mesh filter
- A lid that holds the plunger assembly

Common sizes are 3-cup (12 oz), 4-cup (17 oz), and 8-cup (34 oz).

### Grinder
A burr grinder is essential for achieving the coarse, even grind required. Blade grinders produce inconsistent particle sizes leading to uneven extraction.

## Grind Size

Use a coarse grind to prevent over-extraction and minimize sediment in your cup. The grind should resemble coarse sea salt or raw sugar - you should see distinct particles rather than powder.

### Why Coarse?
- Metal mesh filter cannot trap fine particles like paper
- Longer steep time requires larger particles to prevent over-extraction
- Reduces muddy sediment at the bottom of your cup

## Steep Time

The standard steep time for French press is 4 minutes. This allows adequate extraction while avoiding the bitterness that comes from over-steeping.

### Adjusting Steep Time
- **3 minutes**: Lighter body, brighter flavors, less extraction
- **4 minutes**: Standard, balanced extraction
- **5+ minutes**: Heavier body, potential bitterness, stronger coffee

## Brewing Steps

1. **Preheat**: Pour hot water into the press to warm the glass, then discard
2. **Add coffee**: Use 1 gram of coffee per 15 grams of water (about 2 tablespoons per 6 oz)
3. **Add water**: Pour 195-205°F water over the grounds
4. **Stir**: Gently stir to ensure all grounds are saturated
5. **Steep**: Place plunger on top (don't press yet) and wait 4 minutes
6. **Plunge**: Press the plunger down slowly and steadily
7. **Serve immediately**: Don't let coffee sit in the press or it will over-extract

## Common Mistakes

### Grinding Too Fine
Fine grounds will slip through the mesh filter and create a muddy, over-extracted cup. If you see excessive sediment, use a coarser grind.

### Pressing Too Hard
Forcing the plunger down aggressively can cause grounds to squeeze through the filter. Press slowly with gentle, even pressure.

### Letting Coffee Sit
Coffee left in the French press continues extracting, becoming bitter. Decant all coffee immediately after pressing, even if you're not drinking it all right away.

## Water Temperature

Water temperature should be 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit. Boiling water (212°F) is too hot and will scald the coffee. Let your kettle rest 30-60 seconds after boiling before pouring.
