                  Phase 8 (Directory Renames)
```

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (New User Installation)**: Depends on Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (Existing User Migration)**: Depends on Phase 2 - Can run parallel with US1
- **US3 (Documentation Consistency)**: Depends on Phase 2 - Can run parallel with US1/US2
- **US4 (Skill Discovery)**: Depends on Phase 2 - Can run parallel with US1/US2/US3

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1**: All version bump tasks (T001-T006) can run in parallel
**Phase 2**: Entry point additions can be parallel, but poetry install must be sequential
**Phase 3-6**: All user stories can run in parallel after Phase 2 completes
**Within stories**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Documentation Updates (US3)

```bash
# Launch all documentation updates together:
Task: "Update README.md (root)"
Task: "Update CLAUDE.md (root)"
Task: "Update .claude/CLAUDE.md"
Task: "Update SKILL.md command examples"
Task: "Update troubleshooting-guide.md"
Task: "Update integration-guide.md"
# ... all [P] [US3] tasks
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (version bump)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (entry points)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (PyPI branding)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (migration path)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test with `pip install --upgrade`
6. Can release v1.2.0-rc1 at this point

### Full Release

1. Complete all phases through Phase 6
2. Run Phase 7 validation
3. Publish v1.2.0 to PyPI
4. Manual repository rename (T053)
5. Final URL updates (T054-T057)

---

## Notes

- Tests are NOT included as separate phase (no TDD requested)
- Existing tests updated in-place during user story phases
- Repository rename (T053) is manual and should be done AFTER PyPI publish
- All tasks have explicit file paths for LLM execution
- Version tests must be updated to expect 1.2.0
