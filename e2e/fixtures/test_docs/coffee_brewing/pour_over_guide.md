# Pour Over Coffee Guide

## Overview

Pour over is a manual brewing method where hot water is poured over coffee grounds in a filter, allowing gravity to pull the water through the coffee bed. This method provides excellent control over extraction variables and produces a clean, nuanced cup that highlights the coffee's origin characteristics.

Pour over coffee became popular in specialty coffee culture for its ability to produce bright, complex flavors that showcase single-origin beans.

## Essential Equipment

### Drippers
- **Hario V60**: Cone-shaped with spiral ridges, produces bright and complex cups
- **Chemex**: Elegant hourglass design, uses thick filters for very clean coffee
- **Kalita Wave**: Flat-bottomed with three holes, offers consistent and forgiving extraction

### Filters
- **Paper filters**: Remove oils for clean taste, require rinsing to eliminate paper flavor
- **Metal filters**: Allow oils through for fuller body, reusable and environmentally friendly

### Gooseneck Kettle
A gooseneck kettle provides precise pouring control essential for even extraction. The narrow spout allows you to direct water flow accurately and maintain consistent pour rate.

### Scale
A digital scale (preferably with timer) ensures repeatable results by measuring both coffee dose and water volume accurately.

## The Bloom Phase

The bloom is the initial pour that releases CO2 trapped in freshly roasted coffee. This step is critical for even extraction.

### How to Bloom
1. Add 2-3 times the coffee weight in water (e.g., 40g water for 20g coffee)
2. Pour in a circular motion to saturate all grounds
3. Wait 30-45 seconds while CO2 escapes (you'll see bubbling)
4. The bloom indicates coffee freshness - stale coffee won't bloom

## Pouring Technique

### Spiral Motion
Pour water in a slow, steady spiral pattern starting from the center and moving outward, then back to center. This ensures even saturation of all grounds.

### Pour Rate
Maintain a consistent pour rate of approximately 3-4 grams per second. Too fast creates channels; too slow causes over-extraction.

### Pulse Pouring vs Continuous Pour
- **Pulse pouring**: Multiple smaller pours with pauses, provides more control
- **Continuous pour**: Single steady stream after bloom, faster but requires precision

## Brewing Parameters

- **Coffee to water ratio**: 1:15 to 1:17 (e.g., 20g coffee to 300-340g water)
- **Grind size**: Medium to medium-fine (like table salt)
- **Water temperature**: 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit
- **Total brew time**: 3-4 minutes including bloom

## Tips for Best Results

Keep your kettle at consistent temperature throughout the brew. Pre-wet your filter to remove paper taste and preheat your vessel. Adjust grind size if brew time is too fast (coarser) or too slow (finer).
