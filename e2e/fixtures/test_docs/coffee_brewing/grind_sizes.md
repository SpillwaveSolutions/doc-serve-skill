# Coffee Grind Size Guide

## Why Grind Size Matters

Grind size determines the surface area of coffee exposed to water and directly affects extraction rate and brew time. It is one of the most critical variables in brewing excellent coffee.

### The Principle
- **Finer grinds** = More surface area = Faster extraction
- **Coarser grinds** = Less surface area = Slower extraction

Using the wrong grind size for your brewing method is one of the most common causes of bad coffee.

## Grind Size by Brewing Method

### Extra Fine (Powdery like flour)
- **Method**: Turkish coffee
- **Appearance**: Powder-like consistency
- **Extraction**: Very fast due to maximum surface area
- **Notes**: Only appropriate for Turkish/Greek coffee where grounds remain in the cup

### Fine (Like table salt)
- **Method**: Espresso
- **Appearance**: Feels like fine sand or table salt
- **Extraction**: 25-30 seconds under 9 bars of pressure
- **Notes**: Must be precise - too fine causes choking, too coarse causes weak shots

### Medium-Fine (Between table salt and sand)
- **Methods**: Moka pot, AeroPress (short brew)
- **Appearance**: Slightly finer than sand
- **Extraction**: 2-4 minutes depending on method
- **Notes**: AeroPress is versatile and works with various grind sizes

### Medium (Like regular sand)
- **Methods**: Drip coffee makers, Pour over (V60), Siphon
- **Appearance**: Like beach sand
- **Extraction**: 3-5 minutes
- **Notes**: The default grind for most automatic drip machines

### Medium-Coarse (Like coarse sand)
- **Methods**: Chemex, Clever Dripper
- **Appearance**: Rough sand texture
- **Extraction**: 4-5 minutes
- **Notes**: Chemex's thick filters require slightly coarser grind

### Coarse (Like sea salt)
- **Method**: French press, Percolator
- **Appearance**: Chunky, like coarse sea salt or raw sugar
- **Extraction**: 4+ minutes
- **Notes**: Essential for French press to avoid muddy, over-extracted coffee

### Extra Coarse (Like peppercorns)
- **Method**: Cold brew
- **Appearance**: Very chunky, visible distinct particles
- **Extraction**: 12-24 hours
- **Notes**: Extended steep time compensates for reduced surface area

## Adjusting Grind Size

### Signs You Need Finer Grind
- Coffee tastes sour or acidic
- Brew time is too short
- Coffee is weak or watery
- Under-extraction symptoms

### Signs You Need Coarser Grind
- Coffee tastes bitter or harsh
- Brew time is too long
- Pour over drains very slowly
- Over-extraction symptoms

## Grinder Types

### Blade Grinders
- **Pros**: Inexpensive, widely available
- **Cons**: Inconsistent particle size, generates heat
- **Verdict**: Not recommended for serious coffee brewing

### Burr Grinders
- **Pros**: Consistent particle size, adjustable settings
- **Cons**: More expensive
- **Verdict**: Essential for quality coffee

### Hand Grinders
- **Pros**: Portable, quiet, no electricity needed
- **Cons**: Labor intensive, slower
- **Verdict**: Great for travel or small batches

## Grind Freshness

Ground coffee goes stale quickly - within 15-30 minutes, significant aroma and flavor loss occurs. Always grind immediately before brewing for best results.

### Storage Tips
- Keep whole beans in airtight container
- Store away from light, heat, and moisture
- Grind only what you need for each brew
- Pre-ground coffee is a last resort
