## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Phase 3-6 (User Stories)**: All depend on Phase 2 completion
  - US1 (P1): No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (P2): Depends on US1 (needs graph query infrastructure)
  - US3 (P3): No dependencies on other stories (parallel with US4)
  - US4 (P3): No dependencies on other stories (parallel with US3)
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 1**:
- T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel

**Within Phase 2**:
- T008, T009, T010, T011 can run in parallel after T005-T007

**Within User Stories**:
- All tests can be written in parallel before implementation
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel

**Across User Stories**:
- US3 and US4 can be implemented in parallel (both P3)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch tests in parallel:
Task: "Unit test for DynamicLLMPathExtractor wrapper"
Task: "Unit test for GraphIndexManager"
Task: "Integration test for graph query execution"

# Launch extractors in parallel:
Task: "Create LLM entity extractor wrapper"
Task: "Create GraphIndexManager class"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test GraphRAG enable/disable, graph queries
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy (MULTI mode)
4. Add User Stories 3 & 4 in parallel → Deploy (Kuzu + Code relationships)
5. Polish → Final release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2 developers after Foundational:
- Developer A: User Story 1 → User Story 2
- Developer B: User Story 3 + User Story 4 (can start after US1 foundation)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Constitution III: Tests written alongside implementation
- Constitution V: Complexity justified (optional feature, follows existing patterns)
- All graph features skip execution when ENABLE_GRAPH_INDEX=false
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
